# Overview

This repository is used to maintain the SDMX REST API.

The API allows implementers to offer programmatic access to statistical data and metadata over HTTP.

This repository contains:

- The normative part of the specification, i.e. the [Open API definition](api/sdmx-rest.yaml).
- The [Developers' documentation](doc/index.md), including a [cheat sheet](doc/rest_cheat_sheet.pdf?raw=true).

> [!TIP]
> Each release of the SDMX-REST API is associated with a tag. Retrieving **previous versions** of the SDMX-REST API (Open API definition, cheatsheet, documentation, etc.) is
> easy, using either **tags** or **releases**:
>
> * **tags**: Tags can be used to retrieve the Open API definition, cheatsheet and documentation of a specific version of the SDMX-REST API. Tags are located towards the top of this page.
> * **releases**: Releases are located in the navigation bar on the right of this page. They too can be used to retrieve the Open API definition, cheatsheet and documentation of a specific version of the SDMX-REST API.
